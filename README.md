# monokai-lightmode theme for Atom
This theme has a bright background with dark text and uses accompanying colors loosely based on the original Monokai theme.

The code is a fork of [babsveloso](https://github.com/babsveloso/atom-monokai-light)'s mod of the original Monokai port by [kevinsawicki](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/monokai).
